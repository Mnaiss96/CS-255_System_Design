# CS-255_System_Design

The DriverPass project was based on a request from a client who wanted a web-based system that would allow students to register for driving lessons, schedule practice sessions and DMV test appointments, access online learning materials, and track their progress. The system also needed administrative tools for instructors and staff to manage student data, schedules, and reports efficiently.

One thing I did particularly well was identifying and organizing the system’s main use cases and actors. I clearly defined how students, instructors, and administrators would interact with the system, which made the overall functionality easy to visualize and translate into UML diagrams.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve my UML sequence diagram by adding more detailed interactions between the system components. I’d include additional steps that show how data flows between the user interface, the database, and the scheduling module to make the diagram more complete and realistic.

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on the Client's goals and the problems their business faced, such as the lack of an efficient scheduling system and limited online learning resources. I translated those needs into features like automated scheduling, progress tracking, and online lesson access. Considering the user’s needs is essential because it ensures the final system is practical, user-friendly, and solves real business problems rather than just meeting technical requirements.

When designing software, I approach it by breaking the project into clear stages—gathering requirements, modeling processes, and iterating through designs. I use techniques such as use case analysis, UML diagrams, and feedback loops with stakeholders to make sure the system evolves correctly. In the future, I’d continue using these structured methods while also integrating agile practices, such as user stories and continuous feedback, to improve flexibility and collaboration throughout development.
